| :warning: Captcha solver is overloaded due to high traffic, you might need to wait a few minutes before it starts. I will be adding local captcha solving so the tool doesnt rely on any external API's. |

Automated with API requests, not using selenium or any other webdriver.
Bypasses captcha and bots all available services for a given video.
### Binaries (untested) available for windows in bin
